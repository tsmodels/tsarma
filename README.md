# tsarma

The **tsarma** package implements methods for the maximum likelihood
estimation of ARMA(p,q)-X models for stationary time series, backed by
autodiff (using TMB package). It includes methods for inference,
filtering, prediction, simulation and backtesting.

It makes use of the [tsmodels](https://github.com/tsmodels) framework,
providing common methods with similar inputs and classes with similar
outputs.

The package vignette is available in the new tsmodels site
[here](https://www.nopredict.com/packages/tsarma.html).
